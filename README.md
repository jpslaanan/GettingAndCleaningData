# Coursera Data Science Track - Getting and Cleaning Data Project

### Overview
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

### Instructions
Create a R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


### Data Set
Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.
